❗Post-class Write Up Blog Post: COMING SHORTLY

**Course Description**: Recent work has shown that the representations learned by machine
learning models (and in particular neural network models) bear a remarkable similarity to the
representations we can detect in the human brain via brain imaging. This class explores that
fact through a project, and paper readings on language, vision and reinforcement learning.

**Course Prerequisites**: Strong programming skills, some exposure to machine learning will
be advantageous but not required.

**Course Objectives and Expected Learning Outcomes**:
* Understand some of the basics of machine learning and neuroscience
* Understand what a representation is, and how we can compare representational
spaces.
* Learn how to read and present a paper, and how to lead an engaging discussion
about that paper.
* Get hands-on experience in machine learning and neuroscience as part of a group
project.
   Write a paper about the project, coming as close to a submittable paper as possible
by the end of the semester.
